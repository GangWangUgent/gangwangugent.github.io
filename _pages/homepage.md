👍 Tributes

My research career has been influenced by quite a few theories and techniques proposd by the pioneers. I would like to pay tribute to these top scientists.

* [David Courtenay Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)) (MIT, US)
  * He reshaped the vision computational theory, the book of whom *Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information* has always fascinated me.
* [Tony Lindeberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/tony) (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden)
  * His research subjects concern scale-space theory, early vision and image representations in terms of receptive fields. He has top telents in mathematics, and his papers usually present a lot of complex expressions. However, I love them all, because they are so elegant.
* [John F. Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Canny) (MIT, US)
  * The famous Canny edge detetor seems easy, but the internal computation is super charming. This work tells me how the signal processing, image processing and bio-vision meet together, from a super elegant perspective.
* [Geoffrey Everest Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) (University of Toronto, Canada)
  * He is the winner of Nobel and Turing Award, noted for his work on DCNNs that have refreshed the vision field. I bought ideas from the deep learning features that are interestingly similar to the biological V1 RFs.
