Following the pioneer [D. Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist))'s theory, I mainly focus on computational vision inspired by *neuroscience*, seeking favorable solutions for *motion/static feature extraction* and *visual object detection/tracking*. 
My current positions include:

* **Vice Director/Assoc. Professor**, Brain Research Center, BIBMS, Beijing
* **Director**,                       Neuro-AI Vision Engineering (NAIVE) Lab, Beijing
* **Youth Professor**,                [Chinese Institute for Brain Research, China (北京脑科学与类脑研究所)](https://en.cibr.ac.cn/)
* **Assoc. Professor**,               [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (电子科技大学)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)

👍 Tributes

My research career has been influenced by quite a few theories and techniques proposd by the pioneers. I would like to pay tribute to these top scientists.

* [David Courtenay Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist)) (MIT, US)
  * He reshaped the vision computational theory, the book of whom *Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information* has always fascinated me.
* [Tony Lindeberg](https://www.kth.se/profile/tony) (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden)
  * His research subjects concern scale-space theory, early vision and image representations in terms of receptive fields. He has top telents in mathematics, and his papers usually present a lot of complex expressions. However, I love them all, because they are so elegant.
* [John F. Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Canny) (MIT, US)
  * The famous Canny edge detetor seems easy, but the internal computation is super charming. This work tells me how the signal processing, image processing and bio-vision meet together, from a super elegant perspective.
* [Geoffrey Everest Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) (University of Toronto, Canada)
  * He is the winner of Turing Award, noted for his work on DCNNs that have refreshed the vision field. I bought ideas from the deep learning features that are interestingly similar to the biological V1 RFs.
